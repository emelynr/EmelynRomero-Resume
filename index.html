        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi my name is Emelyn Romero, I'm a first-year student at UC Riverside and I hope to pursue a career in the field of Business.Even though I donâ€™t have a lot of work experience, I am involved with my community and have participated in several organizations. Throughout these past few years I have focused on prioritizing my after school program Heart of Los Angeles, an organization whose mission is to assist youth with programs in academics, arts and athletics so that low-income students like myself, are encouraged to pursue a higher education. I have been enrolled in this program for over 12 years and it has shaped me into the responsible, resilient and hardworking student I am today. Iâ€™m aware that being enrolled in leadership clubs is really important so I formed part of the High School Youth Leadership Committee(HSYLC). In this committee we all take a leadership position in which we have to make important decisions for our program. In my junior year of high school I was the co-facilitator and attendance manager but in my senior year of high school I was able to obtain the role of YLC vice president. This committee has allowed me to take initiative, develop my communication skills and at the same time gave me the opportunity to share my ideas with others. Since it's my last year in high school I decided to try something new and joined my schoolâ€™s varsity soccer team. So far it has been a great experience especially because I have always loved spending time outdoors. Being a part of my school's soccer team has allowed me to become a leader within my own team. Working together with my teammates has allowed me to enhance my communication and resilience skills. In addition to these activities, this past summer, I took part in PA Spring Board Consulting which is a one-week program where I was able to communicate and obtain information from professional business consultants in regards to their careers. Everyday, for five hours, we had to work with our assigned groups and conduct research in order to create a product that would, in a hypothetical situation, solve a world issue. My team of 4 organized, edited, researched and structured a power point that was pitched to "clients". Similar to one of my favorite shows, Shark Tank, we had to persuade the judges into investing into our product which in this case was a nutrient-packed baby formula that would greatly reduce world hunger in countries like Equatorial Guinea. After hours of planning, practicing networking and presentation skills, my team and I formed an outstanding pitch, rich in financial research. We ended up earning the Excellence Award.
<br><br>

        Furthermore, a main goal of mine is to inspire others and become a leader for those around me. As well as ensure that I become a reliable person people can count on so that I'm able to leave behind a positive impact. Leaving a positive impact in my community is important because that means that all of my hard work and ambitions have paid off. <br><br>
